# SwiftUI CardView

This Swift package offers a card view in SwiftUI that is highly customizable. To use it, simply import it and place it into your SwiftUI views!

```
import CardView

struct ContentView {
    var body: some View {
        CardView {
            Text("Hello, CardView!")
        }
    }
}
```

For a full list of options, see the documentation for `CardView.swift`.
